## Development

This portfolio uses a **gradual React migration approach** - the original HTML/CSS structure is preserved while React components enhance specific interactive features.

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve locally
npm run serve
